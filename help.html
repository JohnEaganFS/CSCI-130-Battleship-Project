		<p> How to start a game: <br>
		    To begin a game, first make sure you have created an account and logged in. <br>
			Next, go the "Play" page and invite another player or accept an invite sent to you. <br>
			Finally, join the active game by selecting it in the "Active Games" menu.
			<br>
			<br>
		How to Play Battleship: <br>
			Battleship consists of two players, each with their own board. <br>
			When you first join a game, you will be able to place your ships on your board. <br>
			You will place:<br>
			  1. Carrier (Size = 5)<br>
			  2. Battleship (Size = 4)<br>
			  3. Destroyer (Size = 3)<br>
			  4. Submarine (Size = 3)<br>
			  5. Patrol Boat (Size = 2)<br>
			 <br>
			 After placing your ships, you will press "Ready" and wait for the other player to place their ships and ready up.<br>
			 Once both players are ready, you will rejoin the game and begin the game. <br>
			 
			 <br>
			 Once a game has begun, the players alternate turns of firing torpedos at the opponent's board.<br>
			 The goal is to hit and destroy all of the opponent's ships.<br>
			 When one player loses all their ships, the game will end and the player with ships remaining wins. <br>
